#  MERN Stack Learning Journey

## Introduction
Hi! I’m **Kaviya Rajasekaran**, and this repository documents my journey of learning **Full-Stack Web Development using the MERN stack**  
(**MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js**).

This journey started with the goal of building real-world, scalable web applications while understanding how frontend, backend, and database layers work together.

---

## Abstract
The MERN stack is a modern JavaScript-based full-stack development framework widely used for building dynamic web applications.  
This learning journey focuses on mastering web fundamentals, frontend development with React, backend APIs using Node.js and Express, and database management with MongoDB.  
Each stage includes hands-on practice, GitHub commits, and mini-projects to ensure practical understanding.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the complete **client–server architecture**
- Build responsive and interactive **frontend interfaces**
- Develop **RESTful APIs** using Node.js and Express
- Perform **CRUD operations** with MongoDB
- Implement **authentication & authorization**
- Deploy a full-stack MERN application

---

## Tech Stack Overview
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (Vite)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Thunder Client
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt
